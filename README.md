# Bank-Analyst
This project aims to provide a detailed financial analysis of a bank's loan portfolio using interactive dashboards built in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. The analysis helps stakeholders understand trends in loan distribution, customer profiles, repayment behavior, and risk assessment across time, states, and grades.
